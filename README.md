# Weather Now

Minimal React app that shows the current weather for a city using Open-Meteo (no API key required).

Features
- Search city by name (uses Open-Meteo geocoding)
- Shows current temperature, wind speed and a short description

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

Deployment

- You can deploy this on StackBlitz or CodeSandbox by importing the GitHub repo.

Sharing your ChatGPT work (Level 1 requirement)

If you're using ChatGPT in the browser, use the "Share" or "Export" option to get a link to the conversation and include that link with your submission so reviewers can see your approach.

Notes
- Uses Open-Meteo geocoding API and Open-Meteo forecast API (both public, no key required).
- This is intentionally small and beginner-friendly. You can extend it with 5-day forecasts, icons, or nicer styling.
